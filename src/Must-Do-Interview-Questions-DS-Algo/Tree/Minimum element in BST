//Given an array of size N which represents the elements to be inserted into BST (considering first element as root). 
The task is to find the minimum element in this given BST. If the tree is empty, there is no minimum elemnt, so print -1 in that case.

Structure of the node of the binary search tree is as
struct node 
{
	int data;
	struct node* left;
	struct node* right;
};
*/
// your task is to complete the below function
int minValue(struct node* root)
{
    // Code here
    if(root==NULL)
    return 0;
    node *current=root;
    while(current->left!=NULL)
    {
        current=current->left;
    }
    return current->data;
