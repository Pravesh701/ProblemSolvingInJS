Given a linked list of length N. The task is to reverse the list.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line contains length of linked list and next line contains the elements of linked list.

Output:
Reverse the linked list and return head of the modified list.

// Should reverse list and return new head.
Node* reverse(Node *head)
{
  // Your code here
     Node *current = head; 
        Node *prev = NULL, *next = NULL;
        while (current != NULL) 
        { 
            next = current->next; 
            current->next = prev; 
            prev = current; 
            current = next; 
        } 
        head = prev; 
}
